This is a Marlin 2.x Autobuilder for Ender 3 Pro, board 4.2.7

This is based off of  @zisismaras work in  https://github.com/zisismaras/ender_3_4.2.2_firmware


Auto-Level-5x5 is for BLTouch

CR-Level-5x5 is for CR Touch (includes features to help with Octoprint, its what I use)

Manual-Mesh-5x5 is standard builds if you dont have an auto-leveler

OCto-Manual-5x5 is for assistance with Octoprint and no auto-leveler

I dont recommend using base/default.
